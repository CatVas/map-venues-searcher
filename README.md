To start using the app, first please register or sign up with your existing Google account.

After signing up you'll be redirected to your personal page, where all your queries will appear.
You'll see a Google map on the page. Just type some queries in the field above the map and hit "Enter".

After typing a query, you'll see it in the queries list above the search field.
There will appear markers on the Google map, showing you venues found for the appropriate query.
When you click on the particular query row, it becomes active. Only 1 query row can be active at a time!
If you want to delete a query from the list, press the "Garbage tank" icon on the left of the query row.

Under the map, there will be another table - the venues list for the active user query.
When you click on a particular venue's row, the appropriate marker will start jumping on the Google map.

It is also possible to save and download the venues list in .CSV format.
To do this, please click the button named "Export CSV".

Each registered user has his own queries list.
